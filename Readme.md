# Ration Distribution Management System

Ration Distribution Management System mainly focus on the distribution of ration to the eligible users in most secure and optimise way. 

This project have optimised the distribution of ration by the following:
1. Appointment system: Every user will get the appointment to collect their ration from the their respective ration distribution centre.
2. Secure Algorithm (uncomplete) to prevent any kind of fraudulent so that every piece of ration goes only to its true owner. The algorithm is designed to prevent any outsider from accessing any information related to ration holder to prevent the misuse of the ration card of the ration holder. (The algo has only a basic structure)


## Problem Statement:

1. In the past, many ration distribution frauds of crores are disclosed and few are yet to be disclosed to the public. Currently, the ration distribution system works on Public Distribution System(PDS) which has been manipulated many times by corrupt people which cost the thousand of hundred poor people their monthly wages. 
2. During ration collection, people are seen standing in a large queue to get the ration as early as possible before it gets out.
3. As most of the frauds are done by/or through distributors, a change in the administration powers is necessary.


## Solution:

1. To prevent fraud we need to protect the user data from an intruder for that we need to design an algorithm that will protect user data, store it in a ration card chip, and pass it through an encryption algorithm to prevent the intruder from accessing it by any mean. 
2. To prevent the crowd gathering, an appointed date and time will be given to every customer based on their last date of issue of Ration so that the cycle does not exceed 30-31 days.
3. The Distributor accessibility must be limited and have no access to user data. The working of the ration holders must be tracked.
